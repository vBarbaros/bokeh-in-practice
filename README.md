# bokeh-in-practice

Collection of scripts & recipes demonstrating usual || not so usual usage of Bokeh library

## Main Purpose

* We would like to present the user with more clear and step-by-step strategy when building awesome Bokeh
  graphs/dashboards/applications
* This guide aims at supplementing the
  official [Bokeh user guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html)
  available online, rather than at replacing it
* We hope that the user finds it useful as a reference of Bokeh recipes

## What you will learn

* You'll learn to build step-by-step plots
* Examples start from simple ones to gradually becoming more complex/interesting

## See examples of:

### Plot Lines & Curves (from simple/basic examples to well documented and annotated curves and plots)

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="images/lines/a_bokeh_simple_line.gif"  alt="Simple line" width="200px" height="200px" title="Simple line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/b_bokeh_well_documented_line.gif" alt="Well documented line" width=200px height=200px title="Well documented line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/c_bokeh_two_lines.gif" alt="Two different lines" width=200px height=200px title="Two lines"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="images/lines/d_bokeh_two_lines_separate_handler.gif"  alt="Separate handlers" width="200px" height="200px" title="Handler function for each line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/e_bokeh_two_lines_data_source.gif" alt="Clean DataSource usage" width=200px height=200px title="Clean DataSource usage"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/f_three_lines.gif" alt="More lines and sky-is-the-limit" width=200px height=200px title="More lines and sky-is-the-limit"></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

### Fetch Data from different sources (preprocessed CSV files, directly from the web, etc)

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/lines/work-work-in-progress.gif" alt="WIP" width=200px height=200px title="WIP"></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

* The author of this repository has no relationship whatsoever with the Bokeh product; he just enjoyed working with it
  so much so that he decided to provide some easier to follow ways of working, compared to what he found online, on his
  first experience with Bokeh
* The WIP gif was found as publicly available,
