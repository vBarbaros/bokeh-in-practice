# bokeh-in-practice

Collection of scripts & recipes demonstrating usual || not so usual usage of Bokeh library

## Main Purpose

* We would like to present the user with more clear and step-by-step strategy when building awesome Bokeh
  graphs/dashboards/applications
* This guide aims at supplementing the
  official [Bokeh user guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html)
  available online, rather than at replacing it
* We hope that the user will find it helpful and use it as reference for any of their future projects, as a list of
  Bokeh recipes

## What you will learn

* You'll learn to build step-by-step plots.
* The examples will start from simple and basic examples to gradually more complex structures
* We'll try to provide examples on various ways to plot:

  so much so that he decided to provide some easier to follow ways of working, compared to what he found online, on his
  first experience with Bokeh
* The WIP gif was found as publicly available, at [tenor.com](https://tenor.com/view/work-work-in-progress-wip-hurray-design-in-progress-gif-18632420)
