# bokeh-in-practice

Collection of scripts & recipes demonstrating usual || not so usual usage of Bokeh library

## Main Purpose

* We would like to present the user with more clear and step-by-step strategy when building awesome Bokeh
  graphs/dashboards/applications
* This guide aims at supplementing the
  official [Bokeh user guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html)
  available online, rather than at replacing it
* We hope that the user finds it useful as a reference of Bokeh recipes

## What you will learn

* You'll learn to build step-by-step plots
* The examples start from simple and basic one to gradually becoming more complex

## See examples of:

### Plot Lines & Curves (from simple/basic examples to well documented and annotated curves and plots)

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="images/lines/a_bokeh_simple_line.gif"  alt="Simple line" width="250px" height="250px" title="Simple line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/b_bokeh_well_documented_line.gif" alt="Well documented line" width=250px height=250px title="Well documented line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/c_bokeh_two_lines.gif" alt="Two different lines" width=250px height=250px title="Two lines"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="images/lines/d_bokeh_two_lines_separate_handler.gif"  alt="Separate handlers" width="250px" height="250px" title="Handler function for each line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/e_bokeh_two_lines_data_source.gif" alt="Clean DataSource usage" width=250px height=250px title="Clean DataSource usage"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/f_three_lines.gif" alt="More lines and sky-is-the-limit" width=250px height=250px title="More lines and sky-is-the-limit"></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

### Fetch Data from different sources (preprocessed CSV files, directly from the web, etc)

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/lines/work-work-in-progress.gif" alt="WIP" width=250px height=250px title="WIP"></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  so much so that he decided to provide some easier to follow ways of working, compared to what he found online, on his
  first experience with Bokeh
