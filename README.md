# bokeh-in-practice
Collection of scripts & recipes demonstrating usual || not so usual usage of Bokeh library

## Main Purpose
* We would like to present the user with more clear and step-by-step strategy 
when building awesome Bokeh graphs/dashboards/applications
* This guide aims at supplementing the official [Bokeh user guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html) 
available online, rather than at replacing it
* We hope that the user will find it helpful and use it as reference for any of 
their future projects, as a list of Bokeh recipes

### Acknowledgements 
* The author of this repository has no relationship whatsoever with the Bokeh product; he
just enjoyed working with it so much so that he decided to provide some 
easier to follow ways of working, compared to what he found online, on his first 
experience with Bokeh
