# bokeh-in-practice

Collection of scripts & recipes demonstrating usual || not so usual usage of Bokeh library

## Main Purpose

* We would like to present the user with more clear and step-by-step strategy when building awesome Bokeh
  graphs/dashboards/applications
* This guide aims at supplementing the
  official [Bokeh user guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html)
  available online, rather than at replacing it
* We hope that the user will find it helpful and use it as reference for any of their future projects, as a list of
  Bokeh recipes

## What you will learn

* You'll learn to build step-by-step plots.
* The examples will start from simple and basic examples to gradually more complex structures
* We'll try to provide examples on various ways to plot:

## See examples of:
### Lines
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="images/lines/a_bokeh_simple_line.gif"  alt="simple line" width="300px" height="300px" title="Simple line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/b_bokeh_well_documented_line.gif" alt="well documented line" width=300px height=300px title="Well documented line"></td>
    <td><img src="images/lines/c_bokeh_two_lines.gif" alt="two different lines" width=300px height=300px title="Two lines"></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

### Acknowledgements

* The author of this repository has no relationship whatsoever with the Bokeh product; he just enjoyed working with it
  so much so that he decided to provide some easier to follow ways of working, compared to what he found online, on his
  first experience with Bokeh.
