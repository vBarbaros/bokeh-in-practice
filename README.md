# bokeh-in-practice

Collection of scripts & recipes demonstrating usual || not so usual usage of Bokeh library

## Main Purpose

* We would like to present the user with more clear and step-by-step strategy when building awesome Bokeh
  graphs/dashboards/applications
* This guide aims at supplementing the
  official [Bokeh user guide](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html)
  available online, rather than at replacing it
* We hope that the user finds it useful as a reference of Bokeh recipes

## What you will learn

* You'll learn to build step-by-step plots
* The examples start from simple and basic one to gradually becoming more complex
